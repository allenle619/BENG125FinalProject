Introduction: 
An internet meme is some representation of a unit of information as a phrase, video or project. 
It is likened to a virus as it multiplies through communication between active agents (people) and requires a medium for transmission (internet). [2] This project will use infectious disease models of exponential growth to understand the spread of memes, as done in similar studies. [1]
